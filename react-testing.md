# TESTING WITH THE REACT TESTING LIBRARY & JEST

"React Testing Library builds on top of DOM Testing Library by adding APIs for working with React components." ~ React Testing Library docs

I found it helpful to review the [Dom Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/intro) to better understand what the `React Testing Library` is and does.

## RESOURCES

[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)  
[React Testing Library: GitHub](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library)  
[React Testing Library: A Basic Example](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library#basic-example)

The [Example.js](./src/components/example/Example.js) & [Example.testing.js](./src/components/example/Example.testing.js) files in our repo use the React Testing Library docs' [Basic Example](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library#basic-example) as a starting point for testing an even more basic component. They then expand to use a simplified version of the React Testing Library docs' [intro example](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/example-intro). [Here](./how-to-test.md) is a breakdown of what is going on in these tests.
