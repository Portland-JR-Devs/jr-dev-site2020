Potential topics could be teaching about tools you\u2019ve used and loved, or telling about something from a previous career that\u2019s proved valuable as a software engineer. It should be a fun evening!</p> <p>More details coming soon!</p> ",

It\u2019s more structured and less time commitment than what we usually think of as mentoring making it easier to get started with.</p> <p>We\u2019ll talk about how technical mentoring differs from related practices such as traditional mentoring and coaching, what makes for a great mentoring relationship, and how you can get started finding your mentors.</p> <p>Andrew Hedges is an Engineering Manager at Zapier (<a href="https://zapier.com" class="linkified">https://zapier.com</a>) where he started an internal program centered on technical mentoring to help aspiring developers within the company move into engineering jobs. He\u2019s also the founder of The Collab Lab (<a href="https://the-collab-lab.codes/" class="linkified">https://the-collab-lab.codes/</a>), a free program where early career developers learn from professionals how to collaborate on software teams.</p> ',
